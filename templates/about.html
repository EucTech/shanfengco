      <p data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-duration="1100">
        Due to the poor road conditions in Nigeria and drivers' attitudes, some
        tires become scratched, punctured, or torn just a few days after being
        installed on a vehicle. Originally, they would be disposed of as scrap
        tires because they couldn't be repaired with ordinary methods, which
        caused a significant increase in the cost of maintaining a truck.
      </p>

      <p data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-duration="900">
        Now, you don't have to worry anymoreâ€”Shan Feng Co. Ltd is here to repair
        your damaged tires, reducing the extra cost of purchasing new ones.
